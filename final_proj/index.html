        <p>When Adith Thummalapalli first visited the University of Maryland as a prospective student, he noticed there were a lot of places that weren’t accessible to him as a power wheelchair user.</p>

        <p>To help him navigate the campus, the 2020 graduate and alum member of the President’s Commission on Disability Issues made a list of all of the inaccessible infrastructure on the campus. This included areas on the campus he worked around because of narrow hallways, bathrooms that were hard to get into and a lack of crosswalks, stair lifts, ramps and working automatic door buttons.</p>

        <p>But during Thummalapalli’s junior year, a broken elevator kept him out of class for the first two weeks of the semester. A friend suggested he turn his list into a formal report.</p>

        <p>Thummalapalli sent the report to then-university President Wallace Loh and the PCDI, leading to the creation of the Student Advisory Committee for the President's Commission. The committee meant to “give a voice” to students with disabilities on campus, providing them a space to share issues they have encountered. Many of the issues outlined in the report have since been resolved and current university President Darryll Pines speaks regularly with various commissions on campus, Thummalapalli said.</p>

        <p>Despite the commitment to improvement, the increases in Accessibility and Disability Services staffing, advertisement of ADS services and building renovations — students with disabilities still have concerns about physical accessibility on the campus.</p>

        <p>The university’s campus has 252 buildings, many of which were built before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 regulations were in place, said Dr. Georgina Dodge, the diversity and inclusion vice president at this university. ADA regulations prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities, part of which includes making sure facilities are accessible.</p>

        <p>The university submits a list to the state government annually about physical infrastructure projects the university is undertaking. The list, known as the ADA transition plan, details the money the facilities department requests from the Maryland Department of Disabilities for these improvements as well as the amount  the university plans to contribute, Dodge said.</p>

        <p>“Facilities [Management] sort of steps back, looks at the very long list that exists of all of these older buildings and says, ‘What are the projects that need to happen?’” Dodge said.</p>

        <p>Buildings that are not widely used or visited tend to fall lower on the priority list than buildings that are widely used for various programs, Dodge said.</p>

        <p>The first ADA transition plan was submitted in 2000 and there’s been a total of about $1.74 million spent on university renovations since 2016, Dodge said.</p>

        <p>Before his classes started for the fall 2021 semester, junior public policy major Noah Hanssen decided to explore Jimenez Hall. He had a class in the basement, which was easy enough to get to, but he decided to explore the rest of the building. Out of curiosity, he took the elevator up to the top floor.</p>

        <p>As soon as he got off of the elevator on the top floor, he was met with staircases to his left and to his right, Hanssen, a manual wheelchair user, said.</p>

        <p>“It's allowed to be funny for me just because I didn't have a class up there,” he said. “I can't imagine somebody who you know needed to be up there for any reason seeing that.”</p>

        <p>Hanssen hasn’t tried to report any of the inaccessible spaces on the campus he’s found, but that’s mostly because of the lack of energy he has after wheeling around all day on a campus with hills he describes as “brutal.”</p>

        <p>“There are a lot of things accessibility related that I probably should do,” Hanssen said. “But …school itself is long enough.”</p>

        <p>Hanssen also found automatic door buttons don’t work as often as they should. For him, it’s not always a problem, because he can open doors by himself, but door buttons not working can definitely pose a barrier for others, he said.</p>

        <p>“[The automatic door buttons] are better than a lot of places that I have been, but I don't really know if that should be taken as a compliment,” he said.</p>

        <p>The university installs automatic doors where feasible, according to a statement from a university spokesperson. The public safety department maintains exterior doors.</p>

        <p>Luke Perry, a senior computer science major, said accessibility in academic buildings and in classrooms are a huge problem for people with mobility impairments.</p>

        <p>“I can't think of a single building that faces the [McKeldin] Mall that doesn't have an entrance with stairs,” Perry said. “There is usually always a side entrance or a back entrance, but sometimes they're really hard to get to.”</p>

        <p>After getting into the building itself, getting into classrooms can also be a struggle for students with mobility impairments.</p>

        <p>“Typically, there's always at least one accessible entrance and one wheelchair access button on every building,” he said. “But that does not mean the same thing for classrooms.”</p>

        <p>In some classrooms, it’s also impossible for wheelchair users to sit in the front because the classroom entrance is in the back of the classroom. This poses a problem in large lecture halls, where it can be hard to hear or see in the back of a classroom, Perry explained.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, Perry worked with the ADS office to obtain special ID permission allowing him to swipe into ground floor research spaces and cut through labs, all to get to the bottom of a classroom, but even with this, Perry explained some classrooms just aren’t designed for people with wheelchairs, and sometimes he has to take up aisle space, which can be “awkward.”</p>

        <p>When a building, bathroom, classroom or door is inaccessible, Perry said it makes him feel “excluded.” He feels like everyone is looking at him as he struggles to open a door, which makes him feel even more anxious, he said.</p>

        <p>“I can't really just blend in with the crowd,” Perry said. “Accessibility is just an afterthought.”</p>

        <p>Navigating this university's campus with a disability is often anxiety-inducing, explained Reagan White, a senior microbiology major. </p>

        <p>White used a wheelchair before attending this university because walking around can cause her physical stress. Now, White just walks because navigating the campus hills in a wheelchair is not easy, she said.</p>

        <p>“I'm always worried that when I'm getting into the elevator going up like one floor, people are gonna judge me for doing that. I'm sort of trying to preserve my energy so I can study,” White said.</p>

        <p>She’s also put off knee surgery, knowing how difficult it might be to get around the campus when her knee is temporarily immobilized post-surgery.</p>

        <p>“The idea of trying to still get around just seems like a nightmare,” she said.</p>

        <p>White wishes accessibility on campus was more of the default. Providing more public transportation and ensuring elevators are working would not only be beneficial to students with disabilities, but also to the general student body, she said.</p>

        <p>Even when resources for students with disabilities are provided such as paratransit — transportation services for people with disabilities — are best used for getting to and from class because rides need to be scheduled in advance. It can be difficult to take advantage of paratransit for social events and last minute plans, White said.</p>

        <p>Senior mathematics major Cassidy Hankins, said she’s looked into using paratransit before, but because the service requires users to schedule ahead of time, it’s never really been an option for her.</p>

        <p>Hankins has a chronic illness that affects her mobility. Her ability to get around campus varies day by day, she said.</p>

        <p>Hankins said she missed class often during her sophomore year because the journey from Terrapin Row, where she lived, to her classes in the math and physics buildings, was largely inaccessible. Both of those buildings, she added, have stairs at almost all of their entrances, and the physics building only has one elevator, which has almost made her late to class.</p>

        <p>Now, Hankins gets around using her car and with her campus parking permit and handicap placard, she can park in any spot on campus, she said.</p>

        <p>Even with this accommodation though, Hankins said some of her classes don’t have parking spaces nearby, and the ones that do don’t always have open accessible parking spots.</p>

             </div>
           </div>
         </div>

        <p>Now, Hankins lives in the University View, and said the walk from her designated parking lot to her apartment can be “a lot.” She said she asked The Department of Transportation Services to add handicap parking spaces to her lot before she moved to the University View. After three months and a few follow up emails, DOTS added two handicap parking spots, Hankins said.</p>

        <p>However, since the start of the semester, the handicap spots and the lot are often full, causing Hankins to park farther away from her building. In February, she reached out to DOTS again about accessible parking spots. She recently received a response that DOTS hadclosed her submission without addressing the issue.</p>

        <p>Outside of transportation, Hankins said that while obtaining accommodations such as flexible deadlines and attendance policies has not been difficult overall, she said professors sometimes seem hesitant to give her those accommodations.</p>

        <p>“I've always kind of been able to be an advocate for myself,” Hankins said. “But it has been a little bit stressful at times.”</p>

        <p>One semester, Hankins had to miss a few group project meetings for one of her classes. She said she felt her professor and classmates were not understanding or accommodating in this situation.</p>

        <p>“I'm not just skipping class because I want to — I actually can't come to class,” Hankins said. “I kind of get the impression that some professors might think I'm lazy at times for not coming to class.”</p>

        A starting point
          </div>

          <div class="row">

      <div class="bodytext">

        <p>Among university efforts to improve accessibility on campus is to increase the number of staff working on accessibility issues, Dodge said, including the hiring of ADA/504 coordinator Emily Lucio.</p>

        <p>Lucio’s job is to make sure every department of the university is in compliance with ADA laws.</p>

        <p>Currently, Lucio is working toward designing a new ADA website that will include a form for people to file complaints or requests regarding accessibility on campus. The goal is to centrally locate everything ADA related in one site, Lucio said.</p>

        <p>While there are accessibility issues on campus that aren’t fixable, such as the hills, there are alternatives to those issues, such as the bus and paratransit systems and handicap parking, Lucio said.</p>

        <p>“I know it is not an easy campus to navigate, but that's just unfortunately part of the topography. We have alternative options to help people get around knowing that that's a challenge,” Lucio said.</p>

        <p>Physical accessibility is only one kind of accessibility, said Dr. Carolyn Fink, the director of the disabilities studies minor at this university. However, it’s a good starting point to begin learning about accessibility overal, Fink explained, because mobility impairments are a kind of disability anyone may experience at some point in their lives.</p>

        <p>“It's not really in an ‘us, them’ kind of situation,” Fink said. “It's a ‘we’ situation … there'll be times when you will need these types of services and accommodations.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest areas of concern in disability awareness, though, Thummalapalli explained, is making sure people know what is available to them He said when he was at this univeristy, he didn’t know all the resources available to him at the time.</p>

        <p>“A lot of times, the way it works is, you get what you asked for. So if a student goes in and doesn't really ask for much in the way of accommodations, just because they don't know what's out there. They're going to get very little, Thummalapalli said. “How can we ask for things if we're not educated on what is there?</p>

        <p>In addition to making sure people can advocate for themselves, Thummalapalli said a lot of times, physical accessibility isn’t just about installing an automatic door button — it’s about creating systems that make sure the automatic door button works — which comes down to budgets and staffing, he said.</p>

        <p>Unless someone makes a fuss about it, broken accessibility function often goes unnoticed because the university just doesn't have adequate staffing for routine checks, Thummalapalli said.</p>

        <p>Hanssen wants to see more proactivity from the university on ensuring spaces on the campus are accessible. People with disabilities shouldn’t be forced to constantly advocate for a more accessible campus, he said.</p>

        <p>“I have value being on campus, so [the university] should be willing to accommodate for me,” Hanssen said.</p>
